# mara_x_home

## Goal
This is the repository of my diy portafilter coffee machine IoT project. It's supposed to provide push notifications whether the coffee machine is up to speed - it takes quite some time to reach the brewing temperature - and tell whether i forgot to switch it off after 2 hours.
This is also the basis for my next smarthome projects.


## Architecture
![Mara_x_home_arch](https://github.com/DanielBrkr/mara_x_home/assets/138571169/9c74989e-e923-45b8-8735-589a38c9557e)



*RPI 4 = Raspberry Pi 4

## Project Structure

### Backend (ÂµC and Database)

This is where the MicroPython code for the ESP32 resides "/backend/temp_readout_prototype/" and the regular Python code for the MQTT host, that is dealing with the received temperature readings and pushing them to a database. The MQTT host which subscribes to the topic "coffee" can run either on a PC or Raspberry Pi. 

### Frontend (Prototyping)

The frontend is, as illustrated by the figure, only optional, but it's quiet convenient for prototyping. I've explored two routes, the first one is via a flask server and the second one via the Reflex Framework (https://reflex.dev/), which is a new web app development framework in pure Python. 

#### Reflex Frontend

This is what the front facing page looks like, there will be a lot more temperatures to monitor when the ESP32 is actually connected to the coffee machine.

If you run reflex for the first time you have to init it in the folder of reflex, like so:

```Python 
\mara_x_home\frontend\reflex_fe> reflex init
```

After you did that once, you can run it straight away via "reflex run":

```Python
\mara_x_home\frontend\reflex_fe> reflex run
```


### Next Steps

Setup a homebridge device to access the MQTT topic "coffee" and integrate the ESP32 with the Mara X.
